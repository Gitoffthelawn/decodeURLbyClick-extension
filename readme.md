# Decode URL by Click

![screenshot](https://github.com/roeniss/decodeURLbyClick-extension/blob/master/resources/screenshot_1280x800.jpg?raw=true)

## Motivation

Non-English speaking people always struggle to re-type URL by themselves. Because characters are encoded. English, numbers, and some special characters are not. (see [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding))

So I made a small web browser extension which performs the needed processes with just one click.

# Decode URL by Click

![screenshot](https://github.com/roeniss/decodeURLbyClick-extension/blob/master/resources/screenshot_1280x800.jpg?raw=true)

## Motivation

Non-English people always struggle to re-type URL by themselves. Because characters are encoded. English, numbers, and some special characters are not. (see [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding))

So I made up one small extension, which makes those process with just one click.

## How to use

See description in below donwload links. It's super easy.

Or, please refer to [issue 1](https://github.com/roeniss/decodeURLbyClick-extension/issues/1).

But if you keep troubling, plaese leave a issue. I'll reply to it ASAP.
